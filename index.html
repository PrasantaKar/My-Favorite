    <h2 class="orange">Anime</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
     Anime is the my way of wasting time efficently. The differences in the styles and genre of any anime is unquie. Having watched many anime I believe that it became a part of me. Even though I am not Japanese, and can't understand it without subtitles, I feel that anime is the best. That's why I am learning japanese to know more about anime.

    <hr />
    <p>
      From any sports I have learned throughout my life, Badminton is overall the best.

      <p><img src="img/Badminton.jpg" alt="Badminton" width="600" class="wdn-strectch rounded-corners"></p>
    <p>
      A few things I like about this sport:
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to learn...but harder later on.</li>
      <li>Fast paced game that anyone can play.</li>
      <li>Helps to increase Mental Heath</li>
      <li>Just the best for moblity, exercise, and body workout.</li>
    </ul>

      When one is strapped for time or money, McDonald's is a cost-effective and convenient option for meals. It is a good option for families and individuals who have different food preferences because it offers a large variety of menu items that appeal to all tastes and preferences. The fast food restaurant company has also upgraded its menu to include healthier options and alternatives, which may appeal to customers seeking a convenient and wholesome meal option.
